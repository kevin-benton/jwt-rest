This repo is meant to be a starting point for getting a secured API up and running with JWT based auth. For ease of use,
there are development settings that also include the browseable API of Django REST Framework and the default Django
admin site.

TODO:
1. Allow creation of a new user not behind secured part of API.

Setup:
1. Install dependencies (jwt-rest directory): `pip install -r requirements/base.txt`
2. Export settings (jwt-rest directory): `export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=jwt-rest.settings.dev`
3. Run migrations (jwt-rest/jwt-rest directory): `./manage.py migrate`
4. Create initial user (jwt-rest/jwt-rest directory): `./manage.py createsuperuser`
5. Run server (jwt-rest/jwt-rest directory) :`./manage.py renserver`

Receiving initial token:
> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"admin","password":"password123"}' http://localhost:8000/api/1.0/auth/token

Using token:
> curl -H "Authorization: JWT <your_token>" http://localhost:8000/api/1.0/users/

Refreshing token:
> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"token":"<EXISTING_TOKEN>"}' http://localhost:8000/api/1.0/auth/token/refresh
